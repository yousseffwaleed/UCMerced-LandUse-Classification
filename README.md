# 🌍 Land Use Classification with MobileNetV2

This project implements a **land-use classification pipeline** using the **UCMerced dataset** (remote sensing aerial images). The goal is to classify aerial scenes into multiple land-use categories such as residential, agricultural, commercial, and forest.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Built a **transfer learning pipeline** using **MobileNetV2** pretrained on ImageNet.
- Applied **image augmentation** (rotation, zoom, flip, shear) to improve generalization.
- Fine-tuned deep layers to boost accuracy on the UCMerced dataset.
- Evaluated results with **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.
- Visualized **training accuracy/loss curves** for performance tracking.

## 📁 Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

## 📊 Results
- Achieved strong accuracy on validation and test sets.  
- Confusion matrix and classification report included in notebooks.
